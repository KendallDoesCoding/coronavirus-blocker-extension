## Contributing Guidelines

- If you'd like to make a pull request to contribute, please keep it simple. If you use some higher level techniques I don't understand, I'm not going to approve it because I won't be able to maintain it.

- Please don't make a pull request with a bunch of changes in syntax just for the sake of 'best practices' (ex: changing "if blah == False" to "if not blah"). 

- Try to keep pull requests small.

- MAKE SURE THE EXTENSION WORKS
